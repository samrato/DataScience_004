    "## What is Hypothesis Testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hypothesis testing is a statistical mechanism used to make decisions or inferences about population parameters based on sample data.  \n",
    "- It helps to **prove or disprove claims** being tested.  \n",
    "- It provides a structured framework to define the problem and make data-centric decisions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Statistical Hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a researcher already has an idea or assumption about the outcome before doing an experiment, a **statistical hypothesis** provides a structured framework for testing and decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀)** – assumes no change or effect; old beliefs hold true.  \n",
    "2. **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ)** – assumes there is a new effect, difference, or relationship.\n",

    "$$H_{0}: \\mu = 2$$  \n",
    "$$H_{a}: \\mu > 2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, any new claim or proposed change is defined in the **alternative hypothesis**.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Types of Hypothesis Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Two-Tailed Test**\n",

    "$$H_{0}: \\mu = 163$$  \n",
    "$$H_{a}: \\mu \\neq 163$$\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **One-Tailed Test**\n",
    "Used when we expect the difference to be in a specific direction (greater or smaller).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_{0}: \\text{length} = 2$$  \n",
    "$$H_{a}: \\text{length} > 2$$\n",

    "\n",
    "- If the **null hypothesis (H₀)** is rejected, and the **alternative hypothesis (Hₐ)** is accepted, we say the result is **statistically significant**.  \n",
    "- This means the outcome is unlikely to have occurred by random chance.\n",

    "## Steps of Performing a Hypothesis Test\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State the hypotheses** – H₀ and Hₐ  \n",
    "2. **Choose the significance level (α)** – usually 0.05  \n",
    "3. **Select the appropriate statistical test** (z-test, t-test, etc.)  \n",
    "4. **Collect the sample data**  \n",
    "5. **Compute the test statistic and compare with the critical value**  \n",
